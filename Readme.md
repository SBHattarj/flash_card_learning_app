# The Flashcard Project

My first instinct was to setup react and server rendering to allow a better user experience. I next worked on the server side code. I tried to use as little javascript as possible to not have to deal with the performance issues that javascript can give. I used mongoosh functions to sort and filter the flashcard for the right api. And then I started working on the ui. I mostly worked on making it work, and feel good, and only added the bare minimum that was neccessary.

#development

to develop it's very simple, just use `npm install` to install all dependencies then use `npm run dev` to start the server. 

#Build

To build it's as easy as doint `npm run build`.
